                        <h4>NY Residents - Domestic Violence Notice</h4>
                        <p>New York Insurance Law Section 2612 provides important protections for victims of domestic violence. New York Insurance Law Section 2612 prohibits an individual, insurer or entity supervised by the Department of Financial Services, from the following actions based solely because a person is or has been a victim of domestic violence: (1) refuse to issue or renew, deny or cancel any insurance policy or contract; (2) demand or require a greater premium or payment from any person; (3) designate domestic violence as a preexisting condition, for which coverage will be denied or reduced; (4) fix any lower rate or discriminate in the fees or commissions of agents or brokers for writing or renewing such a policy; or (5) using as an underwriting criterion the fact that a person is or has been a victim of domestic violence.</p>
                        <p>The law further provides that if any person covered by an insurance policy issued to another person as the policyholder delivers to the insurer that issued the policy, at its home office, a valid order of protection against the policyholder, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in New York, the insurer shall be prohibited for the duration of the order from disclosing to the policyholder the address and telephone number of the insured, or of any person or entity providing covered services to the insured. If a child is the covered person, then these rights may be asserted by the childs parent or guardian. </p>
