            <h2>Workers' Compensation Insurance</h2>
        </div>

                <p>Workers' compensation insurance, which is regulated on a state-by-state basis, is generally mandatory for all businesses. This insurance is purchased by businesses to cover their employees in the event they are injured at work.</p>

                <p>This insurance is invaluable to both you and your employees, providing financial protection in the event of a job-related accident or illness.  This safety net is crucial; without it, the impact of a serious accident could be disastrous.</p>

                <p>As workers' compensation insurance coverage is mandated by law, all workers'  compensation policies themselves look very much alike. The same is not true, however, for all workers’ compensation insurers.  When choosing your workers' compensation insurer, it is important to consider whether the insurer has the financial strength to meet all if its present and future obligations.  Also consider whether the insurer has the resources and expertise to service your needs when they arise.  Choosing a workers’ compensation insurer for your business is an opportunity for you to evaluate how that insurer operates its business, not just vice versa.  Does the insurer run its business in a manner consistent with how you want your business covered?</p>
