                <p> Upon receipt, we will review and process the application, including submission to the State. A representative from the Connecticut Commissioner's office will visit you to confirm: (1) your company is knowledgeable about the MCP; (2) you have access to Coventry's on-line managed care services and tools; and (3) your company has an established safety program and a return-to-work program. Once these items have been successfully reviewed, your application will be approved. Then, a Coventry representative will contact you to schedule an implementation date; we recommend choosing one within two weeks of the request. Once set, you will receive an MCP certificate. </p>
                <p> Upon certification, you should immediately initiate the MCP as outlined in the <a href="DownloadStaticDocument?filename=4CT MCP Employer Handbook.pdf">Employer Handbook</a>. As part of this process, you will need the <a href="DownloadStaticDocument?filename=5CT MCP Initial Employee Notice.pdf"> Initial Employee Notice and Employee Training Acknowledgement Form</a>, <a href="DownloadStaticDocument?filename=6CT MCP Employee Notice at Time of Injury.pdf"> Employee Notice at Time of Injury</a>, and <a href="https://www.talispoint.com/firsthealth/?AE=997532665&CAID=BRKHA" target="_blank">On-line Directory of Managed Care Providers</a>.
