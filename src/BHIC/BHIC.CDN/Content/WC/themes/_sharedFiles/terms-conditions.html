            <h4>Availability of Products</h4>
            <p>Not all of the products and services described on this website are available in all geographic areas of the United States. You may not be eligible for all of the insurance products and services described on this website, and your state may require additional minimum coverage limits.

            <p>The website may provide a general description of certain types of insurance products, coverage and services available through CYB.

You are responsible for all activities executed under your userID and are the only one who may use it. You are responsible for protecting your userIDs and passwords from disclosure to third parties and you are not permitted to avoid the use of required encryption technologies. It is a violation of these terms and conditions for you to allow another person to use your userID and its associated passwords, use the userID and password assigned to another person, or attempt to gain access to resources for which you are not authorized. Accessing resources on our website without authorization or exceeding authorized access is a serious breach of security and may constitute a criminal act. </p>
