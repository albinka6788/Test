            <h4>We promise to make the handling of your claims a top priority.</h4>
            <p>We understand you purchase insurance because of the real possibility of a loss.

When you need us, you want us to be available and to have the experience and expertise to deal effectively with the situation. Our toll-free number connects you to us fast and allows us to begin working on the claim right away. During that initial call, you’ll find that:</p>

            <ul class="info-list">
                <li>Providing any needed medical care is always our first priority, and we have access to a national network of preferred health care providers to expedite that process as well as nurses on hand to help develop a sound treatment plan.</li>
                <li>Securing evidence is important before the opportunity is lost, so we’ll remind you to collect the contact information of any witnesses and perhaps take photos of the scene.</li>
                <li>Protecting any damaged property against further damage is also critical, and we can provide some basic tips on steps you can take before our adjusters arrive on the scene (for Business Owner’s Policies).</li>
            </ul>
