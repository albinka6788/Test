                        <h4>Business Owner's Policy</h4>
                        Business Owner’s Policies (commonly called BOPs) are designed to address the typical property and liability insurance needs of a business (plus a number of other miscellaneous coverages) in a single policy.  BOPs are a relatively new product in the insurance industry and were created to provide a simplified approach to commercial insurance for small- to mid-sized operations.

                <h4>Commercial Auto</h4>
                <p>
                    Vehicles used in conducting business as opposed to strictly for personal use are typically insured under a commercial auto insurance policy, which protects the assets of a company from claims.
                </p>

                <p>A Commercial Auto Insurance policy has different coverages that are designed to address particular needs of a business. Being aware of what type of insurance a business needs is important, and deciding whether your business even requires a commercial policy can be challenging.</p>
