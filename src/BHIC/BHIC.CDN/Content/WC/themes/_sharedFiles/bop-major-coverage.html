            <h4>Major Coverages in the Business Owner's Policy</h4>
            <p>The following are the major included and optional coverages in our Business Owner's policy. Most coverages are subject to a limit of insurance which is determined in the quoting process. Sometimes you will be the best judge of the limit of insurance you need, for example when insuring the personal property in the building you operate, and other times we will suggest limits of insurance based on like businesses or for example, based on the construction and building costs of the building you may own. Either way, we display the limits of insurance we are providing and you can always talk to someone on the phone if you have any questions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            <h3>The main coverages:</h3>
            <h4>Building</h4>
            <p>If you own a building through your business or are required to carry building coverage through your lease contract, you’ll want to purchase property coverage for your building. The amount of insurance you purchase for your building is your choice, but it should be based on what it would cost to replace the building, not the market value or recent sale prices. It also does not include the value of the land that the building sits upon since that wouldn't need to be replaced if a loss happens. When you get to the part of the quoting process where you enter the limit we provide an estimate of the replacement cost of the building. This is only an estimate, and the data may not be complete or sufficiently capture the unique nature of your property. It is important to insure your building for at least 80% of the replacement cost in order to avoid a penalty at the time of a loss. This is called the coinsurance requirement and it is common in policies that provide property coverage to businesses.</p>
            <p>Included within the building limit is coverage for additions, fixtures, permanently installed machinery or equipment, floor coverings, appliances used for refrigerating, ventilating, cooking, dishwashing or laundering. If you are a landlord this also includes your property furnished in rooms or common areas.</p>
            <h4>Business Personal Property (Contents)</h4>
            <p>Also known as the contents of a building, business personal property insures property other than buildings that is used to run your business and is on or within 100 feet of your premises. This includes property of others in your care and fixtures, changes, installations, or additions that become part of a building you do not own and that you cannot legally remove, also known as tenants improvements and betterments.</p>
            <h4>Liability</h4>
            <p>Included as part of the base Business Owner's policy, this protects you in the case of third-party claims or law suits because your business is responsible for bodily injury, property damage or personal injury. This covers judgments for covered losses your business is held liable for up to the policy limits plus defense costs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            <h3>Other coverages we offer:</h3>
            <h4>Ordinance or Law</h4>
            <p>This coverage protects you from costs you may incur due to the enforcement of building codes that were likely not around when your building was constructed but which you may be required to comply with after an insured loss happens. There are three main parts to this coverage: loss in value of the undamaged portion of the building due to demolition, debris removal and demolition costs, and increased construction costs. This coverage becomes more important the older your building gets.</p>
            <h4>Utility Services (Direct Damage and Time Element)</h4>
            <p>There are two types of this coverage available. The direct damage portion covers loss or damage to your property caused by faulty or interrupted utility services to your premises. The time element portion pays for business income or extra expense costs from faulty or interrupted utility services to your premises. In both cases, the interruption must be caused by a covered cause of loss to your service provider.</p>
            <h4>Equipment Breakdown</h4>
            <p>Coverage for the breakdown of electrical, air conditioning and refrigeration, or mechanical equipment, computers, or boilers and pressure vessels.</p>
            <h4>Liquor Liability</h4>
            <p>Covers liability you may incur from the selling, serving or furnishing of alcoholic beverages. For example, if you are found liable because you served a minor or someone visibly intoxicated who subsequently gets into an automobile accident.</p>
            <h4>Data Compromise</h4>
            <p>Provides coverage for response expenses and defense liability for suits and damages in the event of loss, theft, or accidental release of personal information. Response expenses include things such as forensic IT review, legal review, notification to affected individuals, services to affected individuals, and public relations services. Defense liability includes coverage for defense and settlement costs in the event that someone whose personal information has been breached brings an action against your business.</p>
            <h4>Hired and Non-Owned Automobile</h4>
            <p>Hired automobile coverage provides liability protection when you or an employee is driving a rented, hired or borrowed vehicle. Non-Owned automobile coverage provides liability protection when an employee has to drive his or her personally owned vehicle for business purposes. Coverage is generally excluded under personal automobile policies when driven for business use.</p>
            <h4>Professional Liability</h4>
            <p>Errors and omissions insurance, or "E&amp;O,"" is coverage for claims that you caused damage by committing an error in performing a service or duty, or failing to do something you should have done in performing a service or carrying out a duty. E&amp;O insurance can be issued in respect of all kinds of professions and activities. When it is issued to cover the activities of professionals, it is commonly called professional liability insurance.We provide this coverage for the following types of businesses:</p>
