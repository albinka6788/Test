    "SupportSubText": "Buying commercial insurance can be a complicated process, but it does not have to be. All of our rates and forms are filed with the various state insurance regulators pursuant to state laws. Traditionally, commercial insurance is bought through agents, who get paid a commission for bringing customers to insurance companies and servicing that business. By selling directly to you, we are not incurring the cost of commissions, and we are trying to pass that savings on to you. We may not always be the best price for every type of risk in every area, but overall we hope to be in a position to cover your business by offering very competitive pricing from an insurer of superior financial strength."
